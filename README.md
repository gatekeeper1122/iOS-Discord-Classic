# iOS-Discord-Classic
An unofficial and bare-bones Discord client for iOS 5 and 6

Unread indicators on guilds are a little broken for now (wont refresh). Unread indicators on channels work fine.

In-app settings aren't functional yet; you'll need to copy your Discord token into the 'token' string in DCServerCommunicator.m and compile the app for now.

How to get your token: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=31&v=PlXrkOj3OEs
(The video talks about 'watch-app settings' because I originally recorded it for my Pebble-Watch Discord Client)
