# iOS-Discord-Classic
An unofficial and bare-bones Discord client for iOS 5 and 6

Unread indicators on guilds are a little broken for now (wont refresh). Unread indicators on channels work fine.

Super bare-bones. Chat is text only, no voice-chat or posts with embeded content (images).

In-app settings aren't functional yet; you'll need to copy your Discord token into the 'token' string in DCServerCommunicator.m and compile the app for now.

Support for iPhone OS 2, 3 & 4 soon
